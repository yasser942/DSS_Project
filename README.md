# Decision Support System (DSS) Project

## Overview
The Decision Support System (DSS) project is a machine learning application built using C# and Weka, aimed at assisting decision-making processes through automated analysis of datasets. This project provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload datasets, evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, and make predictions based on the selected model.

## Key Features
- **Algorithm Evaluation:** Evaluate various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, to determine the most suitable model for a given dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Support for data preprocessing techniques such as normalization and nominal to binary conversion to enhance the quality of analysis.
- **Cross-Validation:** Perform cross-validation to assess the accuracy and reliability of each algorithm on the provided dataset.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback on algorithm performance and success rates to guide decision-making.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/yasser942/DSS_Project.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Weka installed on your system. You can download it from [Weka's official website](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html).
3. **Open Solution:** Open the `DSS_LastAssignment.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.
4. **Build and Run:** Build the solution and run the `MainForm.cs` file to launch the application.

## Usage
1. **Upload Dataset:** Click on the "Browse" button to select and upload a dataset in ARFF format.
2. **Evaluate Algorithms:** Click on the "Evaluate" button to evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms on the uploaded dataset.
3. **View Results:** The application will display the best-performing algorithm along with its success rate.
4. **Make Predictions:** Use the "Discover" button to input new data instances for prediction using the selected algorithm.
